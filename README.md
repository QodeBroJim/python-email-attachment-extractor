# python-email-attachment-extractor
Extracts emails from your inbox based on a given subject/file extension

Once email attachments are extracted, the script moves the email to a subfolder. 
This prevents the script from having to run through a loop that is too big to 
perform quickly while maintaining a clean inbox.
